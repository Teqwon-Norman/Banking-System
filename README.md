# Banking-System
- This is my final project for my OOP class at Morgan State University.
- We were given a combination of data structures to select from in order to implement
  our final project.
- My selection: Classes, Files I/O, Stacks
- Project Idea: Bank System w/ Zelle money transfer feature

- Just learned C++ this year and, I was able to take my knowledge from Python and apply it here
